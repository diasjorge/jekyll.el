Emacs support for Jekyll blogs.

If mumamo is present (it's part of nxhtml) then a multi major mode is enabled for the blog posts, so the YAML front matter will use yaml-mode and the chunks between highlight tags also use their modes.

Current support for ruby and javascript.

*TODO*: YAML front matter requires an extra space after the triple dash so it recognizes it.
